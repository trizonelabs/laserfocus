# laser-autofocus
## laser engraver autofocus for laserdiode heads

###  Work in progress

    Scope is to develop a camera based autofocus system which can be simply added to a the manual focus mechanism.

    Development & testbed uses ESP32-CAM,USB webcams, GBRL-controller,DVD-drive steppermotor

    For simplicity software development is done in Processing IDE & Java 

    Proof of concecpt with BLOB detection Brenner-analysis shows uplifting results.

    This is REALLY a hack to proof a concept. Everybody is asked to joinm, but due to various mechanical challenges makers are needed most.
