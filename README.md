## laser engraver autofocus for laserdiode heads

Work in progress

Scope is to develop a camera based autofocus system which can be simply added instead the manual focus.

Development & testbed uses ESP32-CAM, GBRL-controller,DVD-drive steppermotor

For simplicity software development is done in Processing IDE & Java 

Proof of concecpt with BLOB detection Brenner-analysis shows uplifing results.

This is REALLY a hack to proof a concept. Everybody is called to joinm but due to various mechanical challenges makers are needed most.
